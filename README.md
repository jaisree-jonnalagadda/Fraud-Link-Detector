# Fraud-Link-Detector
Fraud Link Detector is a tool designed to identify and block suspicious or malicious URLs that may be used for phishing, scams, or other fraudulent activities. It works by analyzing links shared online—such as in emails, messages, or websites—and checking for patterns or behaviors that are commonly associated with fraud.
